- **Request Processing Rate:** 1,100+ req/s average
- **Memory Usage:** Efficient (in-memory storage)
- **CPU Usage:** Low (< 5% during tests)

### Projected Production Capacity
Based on current performance metrics:
- **Estimated Peak Concurrent Users:** 100-200
- **Estimated Daily Active Users:** 1,000-2,000
- **Estimated Daily API Requests:** 100,000-500,000

## Security Performance

### Authentication Performance
- **Admin Login:** 552.5 req/s - excellent for authentication endpoint
- **Token Verification:** No performance degradation observed
- **Security Headers:** Properly implemented without performance impact

### Security Recommendations
- ‚úÖ JWT token authentication performing well
- ‚úÖ Proper request validation without performance penalty
