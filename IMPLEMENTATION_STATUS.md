## 📊 Current Statistics

- **Total Users**: 8 (including test user)
- **Total Stores**: 4
- **Total Lockers**: 5
- **Total Applications**: 6
- **Total Admins**: 3

## 🔧 Technical Debt & Issues to Address

1. **Security**: Passwords stored as plain text (should be hashed)
2. **Token Management**: Using simple test tokens (need JWT implementation)
3. **Error Handling**: Some endpoints need better error messages
4. **Validation**: Frontend validation should match backend UUID requirements
5. **Data Sync**: Need real-time updates between user and admin portals

## 🚀 Next Steps Priority

1. **High Priority**:
   - Test complete application flow (user apply → admin approve → locker assigned)
   - Implement electronic voucher system for store/retrieve operations
   - Add proper JWT authentication

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - Avatar upload with Cloudinary
   - History tracking endpoints
   - Password hashing

3. **Low Priority**:
   - 3-month reminder system
   - Performance optimization
   - Advanced monitoring
