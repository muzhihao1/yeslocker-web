   # Assess database damage
   ./disaster-recovery.sh assess-database-damage
   
   # Activate incident response
   ./disaster-recovery.sh activate-incident --level P0
   ```

2. **Recovery Execution (15-60 minutes)**
   ```bash
   # Switch to read-only mode if possible
   ./disaster-recovery.sh enable-maintenance-mode
   
   # Restore from latest backup
   ./disaster-recovery.sh restore-database --backup-type latest-full
