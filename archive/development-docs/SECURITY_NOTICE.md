# Security Notice

## GitHub Security Alert Resolution

### Issue
GitHub detected potential sensitive information in the repository related to Tencent Cloud credentials.

### Investigation Results
- No actual credentials were found in the git history
- Only placeholder values (e.g., "YOUR_PRODUCTION_TENCENT_SECRET_KEY") were present
- All `.env` files are properly excluded by `.gitignore`

### Actions Taken
1. **Removed all non-example `.env` files** from the working directory
2. **Updated `.gitignore`** to ensure comprehensive exclusion of sensitive files
3. **Created `.env.TEMPLATE`** as a safe template for environment variables
4. **Verified** no sensitive data exists in the git history

### Best Practices for This Repository
1. **NEVER** commit `.env` files (except `.env.example` or `.env.TEMPLATE`)
2. **ALWAYS** use environment variables for sensitive data
3. **REGULARLY** rotate credentials and API keys
4. **USE** Railway's environment variable management for production deployments

### For Developers
- Copy `.env.TEMPLATE` to `.env` for local development
- Never hardcode credentials in source code
- Use Railway's secure environment variable storage for production

### Verification
All sensitive configuration should be managed through:
- Local: `.env` files (git-ignored)
- Production: Railway environment variables

If you receive any security warnings, please:
1. Do not panic if they're about placeholder values
2. Verify no actual credentials are exposed
3. Follow the remediation steps in this document
