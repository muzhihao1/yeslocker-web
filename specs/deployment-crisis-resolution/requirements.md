# Crisis Resolution Requirements: YesLocker Deployment Emergency

## Crisis Overview

**Status**: CRITICAL - Complete service outage on Railway
**Impact**: High - Production billiard cue locker management system completely inaccessible
**Timeline**: Immediate resolution required

## Root Cause Analysis

### Current Evidence
- Railway deployment shows "ACTIVE" status but returns 502 "Application failed to respond"
- Even minimal Express server returns 502 errors
- Container appears to start successfully but cannot handle external HTTP requests
- Build process completes, dist files exist, Express server configured correctly
- All previous fix attempts (Express switch, health checks, port changes) have failed

### Identified Issues
1. **Railway Container Communication**: Container cannot receive/process external HTTP requests
2. **Build System Mismatch**: uni-app H5 build may not be compatible with Railway's expectations
3. **Port Binding**: Despite binding to 0.0.0.0, external requests may not reach the container
4. **Platform Incompatibility**: Railway may have restrictions on uni-app H5 applications

## Business Requirements

**WHEN** the crisis resolution is implemented
**THEN** the system **SHALL** meet the following acceptance criteria:

### Immediate Recovery (Priority 1)
- **WHEN** a user accesses the application URL **THEN** the system **SHALL** respond with HTTP 200 status instead of 502 errors
- **WHEN** health check endpoints are accessed **THEN** the system **SHALL** return successful responses within 5 seconds
- **WHEN** the main application loads **THEN** users **SHALL** be able to access the login page and core functionality

### Stability Requirements (Priority 1)
- **WHEN** the application is deployed **THEN** it **SHALL** remain accessible for at least 24 hours without manual intervention
- **WHEN** multiple users access the system **THEN** it **SHALL** handle concurrent requests without timeouts
- **WHEN** the system is under normal load **THEN** response times **SHALL** be under 3 seconds for page loads

### Multi-Path Recovery Strategy (Priority 1)
- **WHEN** Platform A fails **THEN** Platform B **SHALL** be immediately available as backup
- **WHEN** deployment method X fails **THEN** method Y **SHALL** provide alternative resolution path
- **WHEN** technical approach 1 is unsuccessful **THEN** approaches 2 and 3 **SHALL** be immediately executable

## Technical Requirements

### Platform Migration Options
1. **Vercel Migration** (Recommended): Static build deployment with existing vercel.json configuration
2. **Netlify Deployment**: Alternative static hosting with similar capabilities
3. **Railway Fix**: Container communication resolution if root cause is identified
4. **GitHub Pages**: Emergency fallback for static content delivery

### Application Architecture Compatibility
- **WHEN** deploying to static platforms **THEN** the system **SHALL** serve uni-app H5 build as static files
- **WHEN** API calls are made **THEN** they **SHALL** correctly route to Supabase Edge Functions
- **WHEN** authentication occurs **THEN** it **SHALL** work with Supabase Auth integration

### Environment Configuration
- **WHEN** environment variables are required **THEN** they **SHALL** be properly configured for each platform
- **WHEN** API endpoints are called **THEN** they **SHALL** correctly point to production Supabase instance
- **WHEN** domain routing occurs **THEN** both user and admin interfaces **SHALL** be accessible

## Success Criteria

### Immediate Success (Within 2 hours)
- Application accessible via public URL
- No 502 or 500 errors on main routes
- Login functionality operational
- Database connectivity confirmed

### Short-term Success (Within 24 hours)
- All core features functional (auth, locker operations, admin panel)
- Performance metrics within acceptable ranges
- Monitoring and alerting operational
- Backup deployment method validated

### Long-term Success (Within 1 week)
- Multi-environment deployment pipeline restored
- CI/CD automation functional
- Documentation updated with crisis resolution procedures
- Post-incident review completed with prevention measures
